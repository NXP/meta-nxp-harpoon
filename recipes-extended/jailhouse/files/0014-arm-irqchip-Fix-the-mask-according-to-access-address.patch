Subject: [PATCH 14/64] arm: irqchip: Fix the mask according to access address
 and size

The current access_mask is implicitly assuming that it always
access the whole register, but some registers are byte-accessible,
the Guest may get wrong value when it issue a byte or halfword
access to these registers.
